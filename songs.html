    <p>
      These songs are not random.<br><br>
      Each one holds a moment, a feeling, a memory of you.<br><br>
      Some talk about love, some about distance, some about hope —
      but all of them lead back to the same place.<br><br>
      <strong>YOU ❤️</strong>

  <section class="story-screen">
    <p>
      Before I knew love,<br>
      before I knew what it felt like to love someone…<br><br>
      there was just a feeling —<br>
      that someday, someone would change everything.

        <h2>Until I Found Her — Stephen Sanchez</h2>
        <p>
          I would never fall in love again until I found her…<br>
          I said I would never fall unless it’s you I fall into.<br>
          I was lost within the darkness until I found her.<br><br>
          I FOUND YOU.

    <p>
      I was never looking for perfection.<br>
      Just someone real who loved me how I am.<br>
      Someone I could turn to.<br><br>
      And… that was you.

        <p>
          I’m not looking for somebody with some superhero gifts…<br>
          Some superhero, some fairytale bliss.<br>
          Just someone I can turn to, somebody I can kiss.<br>
          I want something just like this.
