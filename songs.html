  These songs are not random.<br><br>
  Each one holds a moment, a feeling, a memory of you.<br><br>
  Some talk about love, some about distance, some about hope —<br>
  but all of them lead me back to<br><br>
  <strong>YOU ❤️</strong>

    <p>
      Before I knew love…<br>
      there was just a feeling<br>
      that someday someone would change everything.

        <p>
          I would never fall in love again until I found her…<br>
          I said I would never fall unless it’s you I fall into.
