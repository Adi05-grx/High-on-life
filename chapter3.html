  <p>
    You are not just someone I love.<br>
You are the place my heart learned to belong.<br><br>
    
    If this life didn’t give us everything we hoped for,<br>
  
    if destiny ever takes a different turn <br>
know this…<br><br>

    I will look for you again.<br>
    I Want you in the next life. And one after that.<br>
    And every version of forever that exists.<br><br>

    Because loving you was never a choice —<br>
    it was something my soul already knew.<br><br>

    You are my home, my peace, my strength,<br>
    the one who understands me without words,<br>
    the one who knows me inside out —<br>
    even the parts I struggle to accept myself.<br><br>

    You’re the only one who can boss me around,<br>
    the only one I truly listen to,<br>
    the only one whose happiness matters more than my own.<br><br>

    Thank you for loving me<br>
    even with my flaws, my mistakes, my overthinking,<br>
    and my broken versions.<br><br>

    I’m sorry for the moments I hurt you.<br>
    I promise, I will never be that version again.<br>
    I will make it right.<br>
    I will keep that promise.<br><br>

    I promise to protect you,<br>
    to keep you safe,<br>
    to fight for you,<br>
    to choose you — always.<br><br>

    No one can ever take your place in my heart.<br>
    Not in this life.<br>
    Not in any lifetime.<br><br>

    I love you, Sankhu ❤️<br>
    Always & Forever ♾️
